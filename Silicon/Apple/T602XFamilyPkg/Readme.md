# T602X-specific platform support UEFI package

## About

This package provides platform-specific code for all machines that use an M2 Pro/Max/Ultra SoC, internally H14S/H14C/H14D, Rhodes (Chop/1C/2C), or T6020/T6021/T6022. Mainly for SoC specific ACPI tables, all platforms can share the same tables because all Rhodes chip variants are the same platform internally just with different configurations from the factory.
