# T602X-specific platform support UEFI package

## About

This package provides platform-specific code for all machines that use an M2 Pro/Max/Ultra SoC, 
internally H14S/H14C or Rhodes. Mainly for SoC specific ACPI tables, all platforms can share the same tables
because all Rhodes chip variants are the same platform internally just with different configurations from the factory.
