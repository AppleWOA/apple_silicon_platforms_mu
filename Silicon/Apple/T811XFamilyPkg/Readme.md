# T811X-specific platform support UEFI package

## About

This package provides platform-specific code for all machines that use an M2 (base) SoC
or A15-based SoC, internally H14G/H14P or Staten/Ellis. Mainly for SoC specific ACPI tables,
this will be broken out if the assumption that the two platforms can share some values for SoC specific
ACPI tables is false.
