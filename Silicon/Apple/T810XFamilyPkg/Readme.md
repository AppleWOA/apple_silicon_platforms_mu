# T810X-specific platform support UEFI package

## About

This package provides platform-specific code for all machines that use an M1 (base) SoC
or A14-based SoC, internally H13G/H13P or Tonga/Sicily. Mainly for SoC specific ACPI tables,
this will be broken out if the assumption that the two platforms can share some values for SoC specific
ACPI tables is false.
