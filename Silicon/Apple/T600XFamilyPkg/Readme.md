# T600X-specific platform support UEFI package

## About

This package provides platform-specific code for all machines that use an M1 Pro/Max/Ultra SoC, 
internally H13J or Jade (Chop/1C/2C). Mainly for SoC specific ACPI tables, all platforms can share the same tables
because all Jade chip variants are the same platform internally just with different configurations from the factory.
